# Expedia Clone
---
This project is intended as a learning exercise. My intention is to reverse-engineer the functionality, features, and look of Expedia.com. There are some features that I will *not* be implementing in this project due to time constraints or lack of access to some of the admin functions of Expedia. This clone will be developed as a single-page application, which is distinct from the implementation of Expedia.

## Tools Used In This Project
- Node.js/Express (Back-end)
